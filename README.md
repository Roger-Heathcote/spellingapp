To deploy your own version on github pages...

- Fork the repo
- Modify the PUBLIC_URL field in cd.yml to point to your fork's deployment URL OR set the environment variable PUBLIC_URL to override it.
- Push a tag beginning with "release" to your repo on github pages.
- Alternatively run the **Build and deploy to production on github pages** action directly from your fork's actions tab.
